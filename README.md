In Biology, people very often talk about the improbability of the evolution of altruism. Specifically,
the only method of altruistic selection that is so far accepted is that of kin selection, which holds
that it is selective to help those who carry genes similiar to yourself.

I propose a weaker method as another contributor: in small groups, harming the group at large may detrimentally
affect the probability of an organism's survival more than "cheating" on group responsibilities may help it.

This small python module is designed to model this precise scenario; the size of the group, the initial allele
frequency, and so on, are under direct user control.
